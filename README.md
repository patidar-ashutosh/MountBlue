@everyone 

I want everyone to practice or learn the basic concepts in JS well.

- Different types of values in JS 
  - Primitive & Non Primitive 
  - `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`
  - arrays & objects ( CRU operations )

- Truthy & Falsy values.
- Learn about operators & operations that you can perform. ( And also operator precedence )

- Learn about how to represent a string in a different ways in JS.
- Learn what is use of template literals.

  - `switch`
  - `?` ternary operator.

- Utility methods ( console, alert and all )
- Declaring variables using `let`, `const` , `var`


Along with these concepts follow the best practices mentioned in the GitHub track repo resources.


@everyone 

Understanding about the errors is also an important thing.

- popular array utility methods
- popular string utility methods
- popular object utility methods
- when to use forEach, when to use array utility methods like map, filter, reduce
- immutable and mutable methods
- error handling (try catch)

@everyone Things to learn in promises
What is a Event loop ?
What is inversion of control in callbacks?
What are `browser API's`?

What is a `Promise` ?
How to create a `new promise` ?
What are different states of a `Promise` - `pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`
How to consume an existing `promise` ?

How to chain promises using `.then`
How to handle errors in a promise chain using `.catch`
finally block in a promise chain

What happens when an `Error` gets thrown inside `.then` when there is a `.catch`
